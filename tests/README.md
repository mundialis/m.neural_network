# Small example script for m.neural_network

- Required test data available here: TODO
- Within [small_example_script.sh](./small_example_script.sh) a small setup is given for testing the addons of m.neural_network
  - For running the script, first download the sample data (see above), and adjust the path within the script
  - Then run the script within a GRASS GIS session
- Note: For reasonable testing the output of the Addons is not always forwarded to the next one. In some cases, the already prepared testdata (e.g. labeled data, trained model, etc.) are used.
